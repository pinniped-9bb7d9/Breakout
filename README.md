# Time Details and Changelist

Forked the original repository and run the project - received a compiler error originated from the 'PowerFireBall' class due to its header file being included in the header file for the 'PowerupBase' class. Removing this include resolved the compiler issue. It took me 5-10 minutes to identify and resolve this issue.
